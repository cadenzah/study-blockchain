## Final Note

We understand this is a significant hurdle to becoming a Blockchain Developer.

We’ve chosen to follow through with Bitcoin as our starting point because it is an excellent way to get started with the core concepts that persist throughout all Blockchain technologies you will come across.

Bitcoin was not only the first blockchain, it was the starting point from which the components, terminology, concepts for all other blockchains derived.

We hope that you see the value in starting with this software, and will continue to do everything we can do make sure you can comfortably get started no matter what restrictions you may have to your local environment.

Thank you, please reach out if you have any questions or concerns about this.
