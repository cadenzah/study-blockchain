## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we'll discuss the usage of private and public blockchains. We'll also go over how to interact between these 2 chains. To start the lesson, we'll go over some basic ideas, then later you'll go through the process of coding this interaction for yourself.

### Public and Private Blockchains
Compare and contrast a public blockchain vs a private blockchain and discuss methods for cross-chain functionality.

### Building a Simple Private Blockchain
Build from scratch a simple private blockchain that creates new blocks, stores data in blocks, and secures blocks with a digital signature using a one-way hash.

To Build a Simple Private Blockchain, we'll work through 6 different parts that, once completed, will have you up and running with the core ideas behind building a simple private blockchain.

- Part 1: Block Data Model

- Part 2: Create New Blocks

- Part 3: Store Blocks

- Part 4: Linking Blocks

- Part 5: Block Height and Timestamp

- Part 6: LevelDB to Persist Data
