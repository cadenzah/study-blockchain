## Receiving Funds

- The `payable` keyword enables a function to receive funds
  - 메서드를 실행시킬 때에 ETH를 함께 전달하려면 해당 메서드에는 반드시 `payable` 키워드가 필요
- `msg.value` indicates the amount of funds received in `wei`
- A `fallback function` is a generic way to receive funds in a contract
  - `Fallback function` has no name, *only can exist one per one contract*
  - Funds sent from a contract to a `fallback function` in another contract have a low gas stipend of 2300

## Transferring Funds

- Funds received by a contract stay in the contract account
  - 코드에 의한 실행이 아니라면, 컨트랙트가 보유한 돈은 외부로 송금될 수 없다
- If received funds are not transferred to an EOA with private key, or used by contract functions, they are trapped forever in the contract account(which has no private key)

### 각 송금 메서드 비교

- `address.transfer()` is safe (throws error on failure; gas stipend 2300)
  - unsafe transaction will not continue forward
- `address.send()` is somewhat safe (returns false; gas stipend 2300)
- `address.call.value()` is unsafe (potentially can use available gas)

## Sending Funds

- Possible of freezing funds; If a contract executes loop and runs out of gas
- Use `Pull`, not `Push` for sending funds: (???)
  - Credit the account; 계좌를 믿어라; 직접 송금하지 말고, *요청받았을 때에만* 해라?
  - When the account owner of that account wants to withdraw the funds, they can call *a custom function within your contract to withdraw the funds*.
  - This is generally a safe way to ensure that both the credit of the account and the transfer or withdrawal of funds does not occur in the same transaction (???)
- Don't use `tx.origin`, use **`msg.sender`**; the direct calling account of that function
