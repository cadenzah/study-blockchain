Hey and welcome to this lesson on smart contracts for supply chain management!

In this lesson, we’ll go over how smart contracts can work as an extremely valuable resource for the management of supply chains.

By supply chains, we mean all the processes involved with the production and distribution of a commodity.

These systems can be extremely large and complex. They allow us to understand interactions between suppliers, customers, and companies. This is true whether it’s for a local hardware store, or for worldwide distribution of crops, music, clothing, or any other product or service you can think of.

Supply chains and Smart Contracts are a perfect match, and throughout this lesson you’ll learn all about them.

In this lesson we'll go overall simple supply chain example using a *local lemonade stand*. We’ll go over the thought process for how you’ll outline and diagram the needs of the supply chain, and from there you’ll start programming a supply chain smart contract using solidity.

You’ll apply what you know about Solidity in interesting new ways, and by the end you’ll be asked to complete a few challenges on your own.

I’m really excited to show you these new ideas, so I hope you’re ready to get started with this lesson on smart contracts for supply chain management.
